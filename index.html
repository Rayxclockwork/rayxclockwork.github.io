        <p>Khar and I agreed that not only should I go to a full time coding bootcamp, but I should try to go to the one in Seattle. She is willing to fund not only my classes, but also my living expenses while I'm attending the school.<br>
            I have started on the Khan Academy coding tutorials so I can get into the school and hopefully begin classes in September.

        <p>I am almost done with my HTML and CSS tutorials! I will probably begin the javascript tutorials in the next few days. In the meantime I have learned to add images, links, and change fonts on a webpage. I even built a travel webpage for Thailand! I'm learning so much so fast and look forward to the possibility of being paid to code. </p>
